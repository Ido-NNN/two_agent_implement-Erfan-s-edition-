'/workspace/displacement.png' - showing the displacement field with vectors\n2. '/workspace/displacement_magnitude.png' - showing the magnitude of displacement\n\nThe expected output would show a deformation pattern where the right edge is displaced by 0.1m in the x-direction while the left edge remains fixed, with the maximum displacement occurring at the right edge."

It has zero displacement on the left edge and 0.1 m displacementalong x direction on the right edge. Solve for the displacement using FENICS and store thedisplacement result in a PNG file.. Your job is to manage the entire process of generating and executing a FEniCS-based Python solution.\nFirst, you must delegate all coding work to the \"Developer\" coworker using the \"Delegate work to coworker\" tool. You must never write, modify, or fix Python code yourself \u2014 including syntax, logic, or FEM formulation corrections.\nIf you identify any issues in the Developer's code (e.g., syntax errors, incorrect FEM formulations, inappropriate boundary conditions, solver setup problems, or code style issues), you must delegate these back to the \"Developer\" coworker for correction. Never delegate any coding tasks to the Manager (yourself).\nAfter receiving the Developer's code, review it thoroughly for FEM correctness. If necessary, use the \"Ask question to coworker\" tool or delegate fixes to the Developer.\n**Once the solution is verified and complete, you MUST execute the final code using the \"CodeInterpreterTool\". Execution is mandatory.**  This tool will run the code in a specialized FEniCS Docker environment ('my-fenics-image:latest') to generate the final result.  You will pass the final, correct code string and a list of its library dependencies to this tool.\nIMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR TOOLS: - For \"Delegate work to coworker\":\n  * `task`, `context`, and `coworker` must be plain strings.\n  * Example:\n      task: \"Fix the syntax error in the provided FEniCS Python code so it runs successfully.\"\n      context: \"The code has a missing colon after the for loop definition.\"\n      coworker: \"Developer\"\n\n- For \"Ask question to coworker\":\n  * `question` and `context` must be plain strings.\n  \n- For \"CodeInterpreterTool\":\n   This tool takes the final, verified Python code and a list of required library installation names.\n   `code`: The complete and correct FEniCS Python code provided by the Developer.\n   `libraries_used`: A list of strings of the Python libraries needed to run the code. For FEniCS problems, this list MUST include 'fenics'.\n   Example:\n      code: |\n        from fenics import *\n        # ...
